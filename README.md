## UniRM: A Universal Large Model for Multiband 3D Radio Map Construction

![model framework](Figs/network_overview.png "Model Architecture")

The official implementation of "UniRM: A Universal Large Model for Multiband 3D Radio Map Construction". 

In this project, we propose a novel framework, UniRM, which leverages large-scale pre-training and prompt learning techniques to accurately generate radio maps across diverse environments, altitudes, and frequency bands. UniRM not only establishes a new state-of-the-art in radio map construction but also serves as a scalable and extensible foundation for future wireless communication applications.
## Installation
### Environment
- Tested OS: Linux
- Python >= 3.10
- torch == 2.5.1
- torch_geometric == 2.2.0


## Data
The data used for training and evaluation can be found in [SpectrumNet](https://spectrum-net.github.io/).
After downloading the data, move the npz and png folders to ./data.
All the data path can be found in ./dataset


## Model Training

To train UniRM, run: ``prompt_unet_main.py``
### Stage-1: Pre-training
- For Pre-train, set stage=0, enable_prompt=0,file_load_path=''

### Stage-2: Prompt-tuning
- For Prompt-tuning, set stage=1, enable_prompt=1,file_load_path='the saved path of the pretrained model'
